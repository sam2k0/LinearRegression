# Linear Regression
Linear Regression from Scratch 

This repository contains different files of libraries and the main program file named "Linear_Regression.py" 

## Program functions 
"model" function is defined which calculates the value of 'theta' variable i.e. trains our model.

On calling "model" function the model predicts values of 
weight for all respective heights and a comparitive graph 
is drown between model prediction and actual values. 

At end accuracy of model is calulated and given as output.
